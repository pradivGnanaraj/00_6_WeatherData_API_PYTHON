# Weather Data API Web Application System Design

## Overview

The Weather Data API Web Application is designed to provide users with an intuitive interface to access and visualize weather data from various stations. Leveraging Flask and Python, this application simplifies the process of retrieving weather information through API endpoints.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Weather Data API Web Application consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend (HTML Templates)**: The frontend includes HTML templates (`home.html`, `about.html`, and `tutorial.html`) that render user-friendly web pages.

2. **Flask Application (`main.py`)**: The Flask application defines API endpoints, handles HTTP requests, and serves HTML templates.

3. **Static Resources (`static/`)**: The `static` folder contains images and other static resources used in the HTML templates.

4. **Weather Data Files (`data_small/`)**: This directory holds weather data files for various stations.

## Data Flow

1. User accesses the application through a web browser.

2. The Flask application (`main.py`) serves the requested HTML templates based on the URLs visited by the user.

3. Users can interact with the application's pages and links to access weather data.

4. When users make API requests (e.g., for specific dates, years, or stations), the Flask app processes the requests, reads the relevant weather data files, and returns the requested data in JSON format.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: The core Flask application that defines API endpoints and serves HTML templates.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for the home page (`home.html`), about page (`about.html`), and tutorial page (`tutorial.html`).
- `static/`: Holds static resources such as images used in the templates.
- `data_small/`: Stores weather data files for various stations.

## Interaction Flow

1. User accesses the application through a web browser.

2. User navigates the home page to view available weather stations and API usage instructions.

3. User can visit API endpoints to retrieve specific weather data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas

## Note

- This system design provides a high-level overview of the Weather Data API Web Application's architecture and data flow.

- Weather data files in the `data_small/` directory are used for demonstration purposes.

## Conclusion

The Weather Data API Web Application showcases how Flask can be used to create an interactive web interface for data retrieval. Explore weather trends and access data with convenience and simplicity.
